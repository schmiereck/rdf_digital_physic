# Task – iter_013

**Hypothesis:** construction: A hybrid 2-bit/cell rule can produce a stable v=c/2 glider by alternating an in-place state change with a translation step.

## Working Directory

Your working directory is `src/` – a **persistent** directory shared across all iterations. Build on code from previous iterations; do not start from scratch each time.
Write results and data files to `archive/iter_013/results/` (relative to the project root).

## Task

Create a Python script `archive/iter_005/code/simulate_hybrid.py`, which is a 1D, 2-bit/cell cellular automaton simulator.

1.  **Define Target Dynamics:** The goal is a particle with an effective velocity of v=c/2. This will be achieved via a two-step cycle:
    - **Step 1 (t -> t+1): OSCILLATE.** A particle at position `i` with state `A` ('01') changes to state `B` ('10') but remains at position `i`.
    - **Step 2 (t+1 -> t+2): MOVE.** The particle at position `i` with state `B` ('10') moves to position `i+1` and resets its state to `A` ('01').

2.  **Construct a Minimal Rule:** Implement a local, reversible, bit-conserving rule that produces these dynamics. The rule should be a permutation of the 64 neighborhood states, respecting Hamming weights. A minimal rule would likely involve a 3-cycle permutation on a few key neighborhoods within the W=1 group to achieve the desired state transitions and movement, while leaving all other neighborhoods as identity mappings.

3.  **Simulation:**
    - Initialize a lattice of size 100 with all cells set to '00'.
    - Set the cell at index 20 to '01' (State `A`) as the initial condition.
    - Run the simulation for 100 steps.

4.  **Analysis & Output:**
    - Track the particle's "center of mass" at each step.
    - Write a summary to `archive/iter_005/result.yaml` with the following keys:
      - `behavior_class`: A string, must be `V_HALF_GLIDER` if successful. Other options: `STATIONARY`, `V_C_GLIDER`, `DECAY`, `CHAOTIC`.
      - `effective_velocity`: The calculated average velocity over the last 50 steps.
      - `is_stable`: Boolean, true if the particle pattern does not decay or grow.
      - `final_position`: The final center of mass of the particle.


## Success Criteria

- The `behavior_class` in result.yaml is `V_HALF_GLIDER`.
- The `effective_velocity` is between 0.49 and 0.51.
- The `is_stable` flag is True.

## Required Output

You MUST end your final response with a ```yaml``` code block in this exact schema (the orchestrator reads it to determine success):

```yaml
status: ok  # or experiment_failed or code_error
artifacts:
  - path/to/created/file  # relative to the project root
metrics:
  key: value  # any numeric results
log_excerpt: |  # last ~20 lines of relevant output
  ...
experimenter_view: |  # your qualitative observations
  ...
notes: brief technical remark
```
