## 1. High-Level Strategy & Trajectory
*   **Current Phase:** Phase 5 (Discrete General Relativity).
*   **Active Direction:** Remediation of Phase 5.2 / 5.3 (Self-consistent attraction and orbits).
*   **Trajectory Update (Iteration 236):** Phase 5.4 has successfully refuted the gravitational origin of our Phase 5.3 "bound states." Matching-paired control runs showed that the apparent 2-body orbit was a **ballistic recurrence** on the toroidal grid, and that the active latency field is actually dispersive for $N \ge 3$. We are paused on Phase 5.4/5.5 and must redirect to redesigning the local coupling mechanism.
*   **Confidence Score:** 40% (Re-evaluated drastically downward from 85% because our primary attraction/orbital mechanism has been shown to be an artifact of toroidal geometry and discrete velocity alignment).

## 2. Strategic Insights & Lessons Learned
*   **The Ballistic Recurrence Illusion:** On a finite $32^3$ torus, discrete velocity alignments can cause gliders to repeatedly cross paths or remain within a small spatial volume, mimicking a "bound state." Without a matching vacuum control ($\eta=0.0$), this kinematics can be easily mistaken for dynamic gravitational binding.
*   **Dispersive Latency Fields:** The current pheromone latency scheme ($\eta=2.0$, $\sigma=2.5$, $\gamma=0.9$) acts as a dispersive barrier rather than an attractive potential well for multi-body systems, accelerating dispersion relative to the vacuum control.
*   **Skepticism Validation:** This iteration demonstrates the absolute necessity of Gate 2 (Falsification Audit) and running identical vacuum controls. A major false positive has been successfully purged.

## 3. Loop & Bottleneck Detection
*   **Toroidal Boundary Bottleneck:** Simulating on small tori ($32^3$) makes it virtually impossible to distinguish long-term orbits from toroidal wrap-around recurrence. Future orbital tests *must* use either absorbing boundary conditions (where dispersing gliders escape the grid) or vastly larger grids ($128^3+$) where the recurrence time is orders of magnitude longer than the orbital period.

## 4. Alternate Research Paths
*   **Absorbing/Infinite Boundaries:** Port the simulation to an open boundary grid where gliders that escape the central region are deleted or allowed to propagate infinitely without wrap-around.
*   **Gradient-Based Gravitational Latching:** Redesign the latency deposition to create a sharp local gradient that actively traps glider bits, rather than a smooth isotropic pheromone field which dilutes and scatters.
