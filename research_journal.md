## 1. High-Level Strategy & Trajectory
*   **Current Phase:** Phase 7 (Particle Zoo) - Sub-phase 7.3 (Antiparticles & CPT Symmetries)
*   **Active Direction:** Formulating, constructing, and testing time-reversed counterparts (antiparticles) of the stable LUT-08 sub-light glider on the 3D FCC lattice, and evaluating whether particle-antiparticle annihilation can be achieved while preserving strict binary and structural purity.
*   **Trajectory Update (Iteration 243):** Iteration 243 was halted by a platform-level token/execution limit before execution. Phase 7.2 remains fully verified and consolidated. The next step is to execute Phase 7.3 to construct the CPT-reversed counterpart of the LUT-08 glider and test mutual annihilation.
*   **Confidence Score:** 55% (Unchanged; solid foundation from Phase 7.2, but Phase 7.3 is yet to be executed).

## 2. Strategic Insights & Lessons Learned
*   **Asymptotic Charge Conservation in Collisions:** Under the O_h-symmetric, bit-conserving LUT-08 rule, gliders exhibit perfect elastic collisions across multiple impact parameters. Their individual charges (chirality, sub-lattice parities) undergo complex transient phases during localized contact but emerge fully restored asymptotically. This confirms these charges as robust invariants protecting the particles from decay during interactions.
*   **Enantiomer Stability:** The stability and propagation of the mirror-reflected glider ($x \to -x$) with perfectly negated chirality demonstrates that the rule supports dual chiral enantiomers, acting as a classical analog to parity-symmetric states.
*   **Mathematical Pre-registration of Operators:** When moving to Phase 7.3, we must define the CPT operations analytically on the grid coordinate system *before* coding, as discrete coordinate projections make time-reversal non-trivial.

## 3. Loop & Bottleneck Detection
*   **Resolved Loop:** Standard-library-only analytical python scripts have successfully avoided dependencies and execution timeouts.
*   **Potential Bottlenecks:** The token limit hit in Iteration 243 indicates we must keep scripts extremely lightweight and direct. The construction of the time-reversed glider must be done using direct algebraic mapping to avoid large-scale searches that consume tokens.

## 4. Alternate Research Paths
*   **CPT-Inversion Mapping:** If standard time-reversal on the lattice does not yield a propagating glider, explore combined parity-charge-time (CPT) operations where state-space bit inversions are coupled with spatial reflections.
*   **Phase 6 (Quantum Emergence) Setup:** If Phase 7.3 completes successfully, statistical ensembles of these stable, colliding, and annihilating particles can be prepared to probe statistical superposition.
